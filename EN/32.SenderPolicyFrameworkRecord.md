**Function :** pn_valuesadd.jsp


> SPF is an anti-spam approach. It is an email validation system that prevents e-mail spoofing. It works by allowing administrators to specify which hosts are allowed to send e-mail from a given domain by creating a specific DNS SPF record in the public DNS. Mail exchangers then use the DNS to check that mail from a given domain is being sent by a host sanctioned by that domain's administrators.
